# Unit Catalog Documentation

This document aggregates every allocation entry currently exposed to the precombat UI and downstream engine templates. Each table row lists the core data sourced from the existing game assets alongside the newly tracked composition estimates.

* **Cost** is denominated in precombat requisition credits and pulled from `unitAllocation.ts`.
* **Sprite** references the underlying PNG asset in `src/assets/units/` as wired through `unitSpriteCatalog.ts`.
* **Soft AT**, **Hard AT**, **Armor**, **Move**, **Fuel**, and **Ammo** are read from the canonical unit definitions in `unitTypes.json` via `unitCombatProfiles.ts`. Armor is displayed as front/side/top.
* **Shots/T** and **Combat Class** surface the balance heuristics defined in `core/balance.ts` (`combat.damage.shotsPerTurn`). These represent the volleys a full-strength unit can deliver in a five-minute turn and the class key used by the combat resolver.
* **Fuel/T** and **Ammo/Eng** are heuristic consumption estimates derived in `unitCombatProfiles.ts` to aid sustainment planning (fuel per tactical turn, ammo expended per major engagement).
* **Personnel**, **Vehicles**, and **Equipment Summary** originate from `unitComposition.ts` and remain living estimates until the order of battle is finalized.

Update this table whenever allocation options, unit definitions, or composition profiles change. The goal is to keep designers, UI, and data layers aligned on both mechanical stats and narrative framing.
