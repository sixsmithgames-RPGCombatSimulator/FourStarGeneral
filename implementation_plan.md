## Deployment Panel Reserve Guard Plan

### Intended behavior
- A deployment click should consume a reserve at most once.
- If the UI is stale and a requested reserve no longer exists in the live engine queue, the battle screen must refresh from engine truth and provide a clear, actionable message instead of throwing an opaque engine error.

### Current behavior
- `BattleScreen` forwards deployment panel clicks directly to `engine.deployUnitByKey(...)`.
- When the same deployment request is processed after the reserve was already consumed, `GameEngine.findReserveIndexByUnitKey(...)` throws and the user receives a generic deployment failure.
- `BattleScreen.bindPanelEvents()` does not guard against repeated binding, which increases the risk of duplicate deploy handling if the screen is rebound in future flows.

### Expected new behavior
- `BattleScreen` performs a live reserve preflight before issuing a deployment command.
- If the target hex is already occupied by the just-placed unit and the reserve is gone, the second event is treated as a duplicate and ignored after a mirror refresh.
- If the reserve is genuinely absent, the user receives a structured deployment-panel error that explains what was attempted, what went wrong, and what to do next.
- Panel event binding is idempotent.

### Edge cases
- Duplicate deploy events for the same hex and unit key.
- Stale UI state where the panel still advertises a reserve that the engine has already consumed.
- Mixed reserve queues where the requested unit key must still be matched through scenario-type aliasing.

### Impact analysis
- Systems consuming this output:
  - `DeploymentPanel` event stream into `BattleScreen`
  - `DeploymentState` mirror refresh flow
  - `GameEngine.deployUnitByKey(...)`
- Events depending on this structure:
  - Deployment panel `deploy` events
  - `battleState.emitBattleUpdate("deploymentUpdated")`
- Visual behaviors that could shift:
  - Deployment failures should now refresh the panel back to live reserve counts before presenting an error.
  - Duplicate deploy clicks should no longer surface a false-negative panel error after a successful placement.

### Verification
- Add a focused regression test in `tests/BattleScreen.missionFlow.test.ts` covering duplicate/stale deploy handling.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run the focused battle-screen test harness.

## AT Gun Preview Transparency Plan

### Intended behavior
- The attack confirmation modal should distinguish between authored unit stats and the range-adjusted combat math actually used for the shot.
- Anti-tank previews should explicitly show when `hardAttack` and armor penetration both influence the final damage-per-hit result.

### Current behavior
- `BattleScreen` labels the already range-adjusted accuracy term as `Base`, which reads like the unit's authored `accuracyBase`.
- The damage breakdown omits the attack-type scalar and the AP-vs-armor scalar, so anti-tank fire looks like it is skipping `hardAttack` or penetration even when the engine is applying both.

### Expected new behavior
- The preview should show the authored range-table value, the per-unit accuracy scalar, and the resulting base accuracy as separate steps.
- The damage breakdown should show the attack scalar (`softAttack` or `hardAttack`) and the penetration scalar (`effectiveAP` vs `facingArmor`) before commander bonuses.
- The modal should also surface the attacking weapon inputs (`accuracyBase`, attack stat, and AP) so the player can reconcile the preview with the unit card.

### Edge cases
- Soft targets should show `Soft attack` instead of `Hard attack`.
- Unarmored targets should explicitly indicate that no armor resistance applied.
- High-experience anti-tank units should still show their AP bonus separately from the authored AP stat.

### Impact analysis
- Systems consuming this output:
  - `BattleScreen` attack confirmation modal
  - Shared combat previews returned by `GameEngine.previewAttack(...)`
- Events depending on this structure:
  - Attack-confirmation modal refresh when a player selects a target
  - Stance re-preview refresh triggered by the attack dialog buttons
- Visual behaviors that could shift:
  - The detailed breakdown text in the attack modal becomes more explicit about range-base accuracy and armor-penetration math.
  - AT-gun previews should no longer look like they are using the wrong unit's base accuracy.

### Verification
- Add a focused combat test proving AT-gun damage responds to both `hardAttack` and AP.
- Add a battle-screen preview test asserting the modal text exposes range-table accuracy and penetration math.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run a focused harness pass for the new AT-gun combat and preview tests.

## AT Gun Sustainment Balance Plan

### Intended behavior
- The 50mm AT-gun battery should model four guns sustaining materially higher fire volume per turn.
- The unit should carry enough ammunition to support that increased fire schedule without immediately exhausting the battery.

### Current behavior
- The shared towed AT profile uses `6` shots per turn.
- `AT_Gun_50mm` carries `5` ammo.

### Expected new behavior
- The towed AT profile should resolve `120` shots per turn, reflecting four guns firing roughly 30 rounds per minute across the turn window.
- `AT_Gun_50mm` should carry `6` ammo.
- The tuning entry should document that the battery's tow trucks keep enough rounds close at hand to sustain the higher fire plan.

### Impact analysis
- Systems consuming this output:
  - Shared combat resolution in `src/core/Combat.ts`
  - Player attack previews and activity summaries
  - AI combat simulations using the same attack resolver
- Visual behaviors that could shift:
  - AT-gun previews and combat results will show substantially higher expected damage than the prior 6-shot abstraction.

### Verification
- Update the focused AT-gun combat regression to the new shot-volume expectation.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run the focused compiled harness for the AT-gun tests.

## Artillery Observer Tempo Plan

### Intended behavior
- Calling off-map heavy artillery should not consume the observing unit's action for the turn.
- Canceling a queued artillery strike should preserve the caller's real movement/attack state instead of resetting it.

### Current behavior
- `queueSupportActionFromUnit(...)` commits the caller through `resolveCommittedFieldActionFlags(...)`.
- `cancelQueuedSupport(...)` resets the caller back to default action flags, which can incorrectly restore movement or attacks that were already spent before the support order.

### Expected new behavior
- Queueing an artillery support action should leave the caller's movement and attack flags unchanged.
- Canceling a queued artillery support action should only clear the queued marker and support asset state, while keeping the caller's action flags intact.

### Impact analysis
- Systems consuming this output:
  - `BattleScreen` artillery targeting flow
  - `GameEngine.getUnitCommandState(...)`
  - Idle-unit registry and selection intel refresh after support scheduling/canceling
- Visual behaviors that could shift:
  - A unit can call artillery and still retain its normal command options for the turn.
  - Canceling a queued artillery strike no longer falsely refreshes the caller to a fully unused state.

### Verification
- Add a focused regression proving queued artillery leaves the caller's action state untouched.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run a focused compiled harness for the updated command-state test.

## Connected Supply Upkeep Plan

### Intended behavior
- Units that remain connected to supply should only lose onboard ammo when they actually fire and only lose onboard fuel when they actually move.
- Passive supply upkeep should represent depot consumption, not silent depletion of the unit's carried magazines or fuel tanks.

### Current behavior
- `applyUpkeepForUnit(...)` charges the faction stockpile first, but when the depot runs short it falls back to draining the connected unit's onboard ammo and fuel.
- In missions with many linked defenders such as Town Defense, this makes units look like they are spending ammo faster than they fire.

### Expected new behavior
- Connected-unit upkeep should debit only the faction stockpile.
- If the depot cannot cover upkeep, the shortfall remains a logistics problem instead of silently reducing the unit's onboard ammo or fuel.
- Town Defense's authored `AT_Gun_50mm` loadout should match the updated six-round baseline.

### Impact analysis
- Systems consuming this output:
  - `GameEngine` supply tick and logistics snapshots
  - Unit intel panels reading live onboard ammo and fuel
  - Scenario-authored Town Defense unit loadouts
- Visual behaviors that could shift:
  - Connected defenders stop losing ammo between turns unless they actually fired.
  - Town Defense AT guns now spawn with the same six-round ammo load as the shared unit definition.

### Verification
- Add a focused logistics regression proving a connected unit keeps its onboard ammo when depot ammo is empty.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run a focused compiled harness for the logistics regression.

## Precombat Depot Handoff Plan

### Intended behavior
- Ammunition and fuel packages bought during precombat should increase the live player depot stock that the battle logistics panel and supply engine read on turn one.
- The logistics resupply queue should use compact single-line rows, with the active selector state carrying the priority instead of redundant prose.

### Current behavior
- Precombat only hands deployable unit entries into battle; `ammo` and `fuel` purchases affect budget math but never reach the engine depot baseline.
- The logistics priority list renders large stacked cards and repeats the selected priority in text even though the active button already shows it.

### Expected new behavior
- Precombat allocation summaries should retain the purchased depot package.
- Battle initialization should inject that package into the player's initial depot stock.
- The logistics popup should render each priority target as a compact row with status, demand summary, and priority buttons on one line where space allows.

### Impact analysis
- Systems consuming this output:
  - `PrecombatScreen` allocation summary persistence
  - `BattleScreen` engine bootstrap configuration
  - `GameEngine` player depot baseline seeding
  - `PopupManager` logistics queue rendering
- Visual behaviors that could shift:
  - Depot ammo and fuel now start higher when the commander bought supply packages in precombat.
  - Logistics priority entries become much denser and no longer show a separate "Current priority" line.

### Verification
- Add a focused logistics regression proving initial depot stock augments the turn-one logistics snapshot.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run a focused compiled harness for the logistics regression suite.
